Meeting: Product Planning Session
Date: December 16, 2024
Attendees: Sarah Johnson, Mike Chen, Alex Rodriguez

Sarah: Thanks everyone for joining today's planning session. We need to finalize our Q1 roadmap.

Mike: I've been working on the user authentication system. Sarah, can you review the security documentation by Friday? It's critical for our launch.

Sarah: Absolutely, I'll prioritize that. Alex, we also need you to set up the CI/CD pipeline by next Tuesday. The development team is waiting on this.

Alex: Sure thing. I'll also need to coordinate with the DevOps team on the deployment strategy. Mike, can you help me with the database migration scripts?

Mike: Of course. I'll prepare those by Thursday. We should also schedule a demo for the stakeholders next Friday.

Sarah: Great idea. Alex, can you send out the calendar invites? Also, we need someone to update the project documentation before the demo.

Alex: I'll handle the invites today. Mike, since you know the technical details best, could you update the documentation?

Mike: I'll get that done by Wednesday. One more thing - we need to conduct user testing for the new features. Sarah, this might be perfect for your team.

Sarah: Agreed. I'll organize the user testing sessions for next week. We should aim to complete testing by December 27th.

Alex: Perfect. Let's also make sure we have monitoring set up for the production environment. I'll work on that this week.

Sarah: Excellent. I think we have a solid plan. Let's reconvene next Monday to check progress.
